### install R and RSudio

Everyone should download both R and R studio. 

To download R, go [here](http://cran.mtu.edu/) and click on the appropriate link for your operating system. An installer should take you through a series of steps and install R onto your computer.

RStudio is a program that makes it easier to work with R. RStudio combines executing lines of code, writing code, and viewing plots in a single interface. There are a bunch of other advantages for working with RStudio that won’t make sense to talk about now.

To download RStudio go [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and click on your operating system under ‘Installers’. An installer will appear to guide you through the installation.

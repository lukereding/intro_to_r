### install R and RStudio

Everyone should download both R and RStudio. 

To download R, go [here](http://cran.mtu.edu/) and click on the appropriate link for your operating system. An installer should take you through a series of steps and install R onto your computer.

RStudio is a program that makes it easier to work with R. RStudio combines executing lines of code, writing code, and viewing plots in a single interface. There are a bunch of other advantages for working with RStudio that won’t make sense to talk about now, but trust me that it makes sense to use RStudio.

To download RStudio go [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and click on your operating system under ‘Installers’. An installer will appear to guide you through the installation.

### download data files

Click [here](https://github.com/lukereding/intro_to_r/archive/master.zip) to download all the materials I’ll use in class today. Once you unzip the file, you’ll find a folder called ‘data’. These contain the data files we’ll use in class today.

### install the `tidyverse` package

Open RStudio. Go to the Console. Type in `install.packages("tidyverse")` to install the `tidyverse` package.

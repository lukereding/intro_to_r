### install R and RStudio

Everyone should download both R and RStudio. 

To download R, go [here](http://cran.mtu.edu/) and click on the appropriate link for your operating system. An installer should take you through a series of steps and install R onto your computer.

RStudio is a program that makes it easier to work with R. RStudio combines executing lines of code, writing code, and viewing plots in a single interface. There are a bunch of other advantages for working with RStudio that won’t make sense to talk about now, but trust me that it makes sense to use RStudio.

To download RStudio go [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and click on your operating system under ‘Installers’. An installer will appear to guide you through the installation.

### download data files

Click [here](https://github.com/lukereding/intro_to_r/archive/master.zip) to download all the materials I’ll use in class today. Once you unzip the file, you’ll find a folder called ‘data’. These contain the data files we’ll use in class today.

**Note:** Clicking on the link above downloads a zip file. A zip file is a single, compressed file. You'll need to uncompress it before you can read in the data to R. This is especially confusing on Windows since you can double click on the zip file and see all the uncompressed files within it--thus making you think you've uncompressed the zip file--without actually uncompressing the zip file.

**Vista users:** Right click the zip file, probably called `intro_to_r-master.zip`, and choose `extract here`.      
**Other Windows users:** Right click and choose 'Unzip with 7zip' or whatever unzipping software you have.        
**Mac users**: Double click the zip file. It should extract the folder automatically. If not, use an unzipping software like Zipeg to unzip. 

You know the zip file has been uncompressed when you see a folder called `intro_to_r_master` without the `.zip` at the end.

### install the `tidyverse` package

Open RStudio. Go to the Console. Type in `install.packages("tidyverse")` to install the `tidyverse` package.
